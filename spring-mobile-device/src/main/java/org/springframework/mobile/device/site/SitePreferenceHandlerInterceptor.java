/**
 * A Spring MVC interceptor that, on preHandle, delegates to a {@link SitePreferenceHandler} to resolve the SitePreference of the user that originated the web request.
 * The resolved SitePreference is exported as a request attribute under the well-known name of {@link SitePreferenceHandler#CURRENT_SITE_PREFERENCE_ATTRIBUTE}.
 * Request handlers such as @Controllers and views may then access the currentSitePreference to vary their control and rendering logic, respectively.
 * 
 * Note: do not use this interceptor in conjunction with the SiteSwitcherHandlerInterceptor, as the switcher internally delegates to a {@link SitePreferenceHandler} as part of its own workflow.
 * This interceptor should only be used when site switching is not needed but site preference management is still desired.
