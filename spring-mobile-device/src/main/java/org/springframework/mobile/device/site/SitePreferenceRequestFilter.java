/**
 * A Servlet 2.3 Filter that delegates to a {@link SitePreferenceHandler} to resolve the SitePreference of the user 
 * that originated the web request. The resolved SitePreference is exported as a request attribute under the well-known 
 * name of {@link SitePreferenceHandler#CURRENT_SITE_PREFERENCE_ATTRIBUTE}. Request handlers such as @Controllers and 
 * views may then access the currentSitePreference to vary their control and rendering logic, respectively.
 * 
 * Note: do not use this filter in conjunction with the SiteSwitcherRequestFilter, as the switcher internally delegates 
 * to a {@link SitePreferenceHandler} as part of its own workflow. This filter should only be used when site switching 
 * is not needed but site preference management is still desired.
